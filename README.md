# Introduction

  > In computing, hardening is usually the process of securing a system by reducing its surface of vulnerability, which is larger when a system performs more functions; in principle a single-function system is more secure than a multipurpose one. The main goal of systems hardening is to reduce security risk by eliminating potential attack vectors and condensing the systemâ€™s attack surface.

## How to use?

All items in this checklist contains three levels of priority:

* <img src="https://github.com/trimstray/working-template/blob/master/doc/img/low.png" alt="low"> means that the item has a **low** priority.
* <img src="https://github.com/trimstray/working-template/blob/master/doc/img/medium.png" alt="medium"> means that the item has a **medium** priority. You shouldn't avoid tackling that item.
* <img src="https://github.com/trimstray/working-template/blob/master/doc/img/high.png" alt="high"> means that the item has a **high** priority. You can't avoid following that rule and implement the corrections recommended.

## OpenSCAP

<img src="https://github.com/trimstray/working-template/blob/master/doc/img/openscap_logo.png" alt="OpenSCAP" align="left">

<p align="justify">
<b>SCAP</b> (<i>Security Content Automation Protocol</i>) provides a mechanism to check configurations, vulnerability management and evaluate policy compliance for a variety of systems. One of the most popular implementations of SCAP is <b>OpenSCAP</b> and it is very helpful for vulnerability assessment and also as hardening helper.

I tried to make this list fully compatible with OpenSCAP standard and rules.
